# Backbone Nutionion API app
This is a nutrition and health app using Backbone.  It is an optional project for the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree

## Installation
currently all files are in src/ and you need to load index.html on a server.  A basic form submit should display 
results in the results div.

## Issues
- BMI api not very robust; need to to metric-standard conversions resulting in rounding errors
- need to implement build process
